/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 * Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]

      left++;

      right--;

      return [left + 1, right + 1];
